# Project Blueprint: Hairstyle Recommendation Website (HairSwipe)

## Overview
HairSwipe is a modern, framework-less web application that provides personalized hairstyle recommendations based on user characteristics like face shape, hair type, and hair length.

## Implemented Features
- **Dynamic Recommendations:** Filters a library of hairstyles based on user preferences.
- **Web Components:** Uses custom elements for encapsulated UI (e.g., `<hairstyle-card>`).
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and modern layouts.
- **Dark Mode / Light Mode:** Includes a theme toggle with persistence using `localStorage`.
- **Affiliate Inquiry Form:** A simple partnership inquiry form integrated with Formspree.
- **Community Comments:** **New!** Integrated Disqus for user discussions and feedback at the bottom of the page.
- **Modern CSS:** Utilizes CSS variables, transitions, and polished shadows for a premium feel.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main structure, theme toggle UI, inquiry form, and Disqus embed.
